Hi there! Welcome to the Programming Club web design IDE!

To get you started, we included a website template for you to use.


## HTML Coding Activity #1

1) Create a new folder, name it after your name. (Ex. john for John)

2) Open the websites/index.html file and copy it to your folder.

3) Double click on your index.html file in your folder and replace [Your Name] with your actual name.

4) Click Run at the top and watch the magic happen! You should see a new tab pop up at the bottom, click the link where it says:

Starting Apache httpd, serving https://codeclub-rhs.c9users.io/websites/[yourname]/index.html.

Then click "Open" and you're on your very own website! :D

Happy coding!
